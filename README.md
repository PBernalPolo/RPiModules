# RPiModules
Modest classes that implement some functionality to read from Sense HAT I2C devices using Processing in Raspberry Pi

These classes use the Processing library "Hardware I/O" that can be downloaded doing:
- Sketch -> Import Library... -> Add Library... -> Libraries -> Hardware I/O

DISCLAIMER: the SenseHAT could be permanently damaged if one performs certain operations.
In fact, I damaged the humidity sensor and the pressure sensor when I was experimenting.

What I mean is that is shared "WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY".
Although my humidity sensor and my pressure sensor are damaged, I have been able to use satisfactorily the accelerometer, the gyroscope, and the magnetometer with this code.

If you are brave enough to test this code with the humidity sensor or with the pressure sensor, please let me know your results.
